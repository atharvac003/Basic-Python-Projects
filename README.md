# Basic-Python-Projects
Projects I built while following an online Python Bootcamp
1) The first is a "Caesar Cipher" that is based on shifting each letter of an input plaintext message by a certain number of letters
2) The second is a simple recreation of the popular hangman game of word guessing
3) The last is a relatively simple "Password Generator" that operates on user request for symbols, etc
